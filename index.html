  <h1> lost stars </h1>
  <h2> this song is one of my favorit song
  <p>Please dont see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
  Please see me reaching out for someone I cant see
  Take my hand lets see where we wake up tomorrow
  Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
  Id be damned Cupids demanding back his arrow
  So lets get drunk on our tears and
  God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
  Its hunting season and the lambs are on the run
  Searching for meaning

  But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?</p>
